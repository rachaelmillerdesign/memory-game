NO ORDINARY WORLD MEMORY GAME

As the capstone project for General Assembly's bootcamp-style, 520+ hours, Web Development Immersive, I created a memory game featuring artwork I had done of a variety of animals, mostly endangered. It is a single page, cloud-based, full-stack application.

The deployed site can be found here:

This GitHub page is the front end of the application. The back end can be found here:

This app required:

- Building a single-page application (SPA) with basic user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out, change password) that interacts with a custom API (Application Programming Interface) built by me.
- Creating an app that can create, read, update and delete data in an SQL base.
- Creating user stories and wireframes as part of planning the app prior to coding.
- Designing and implementing  a client-facing user interface.

WIREFRAMES

The wireframes I sketched prior to starting coding speak to a vision I have for a website I am going to build: No Ordinary World. This memory game will be a feature of a site devoted to promoting awareness and funding for endangered species.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Ruby, Rails, JSON, a SQL-Postgres database , Curl, API, Photoshop, Illustrator, GitHub, and Heroku

USER STORIES

- as a user I want to play memory match games
- as a user I can sign up / in / out and change password
- as a user, if I complete a game I have the option of saving animals matched to 'my favorites'
- as a user I can browse the animal database to learn more about the individual creatures
- as a non-signed in user I can browse the animal databasE



FUTURE FEATURES:

- When the user collects a certain number of 'favorites', they get to select and download a free screensaver
- Each animal will have a page with information including common name, latin name, description, habitat, IUCN status, and links to resources for learning more.
